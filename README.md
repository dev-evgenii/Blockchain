Block Structure: Each block contains data, a timestamp, the hash of the previous block, and its own hash.

Proof-of-Work: The MineBlock method implements a simple mining algorithm.

Chain Integrity: The IsChainValid method checks the validity of the entire chain.

Genesis Block: The first block is initialized when the blockchain is created.
